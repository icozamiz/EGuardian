# EGuardian


The main objective of this project is to create a non-invasive product that will allow for a way to better communicate with the elderly people in our lives and ensure that they are safe and healthy when the caretakers are not around. This project will consist of two components; a bracelet type hardware that can be worn to track information such as vital signs and allow for immediate contacting of the caretaker. The second portion will consist of a mobile application to allow for the caretaker to monitor the wearer of the bracelet and have a form of immediate communication if the need ever arise. This repository consists of the development of the mobile android application.
